# Batman Mono Theme

<img src="images/logo.png" alt="Logo" width="128"/>

A theme inspired from Atom's famous "Mono UI" theme. Nothing fancy here.. Tried to make it easy to work at nights, it is also easy on eyes. Not too many colors to distract and only important panels are highlighted..

Still experimenting, therefore I might play with colors over time.

Here are a few screenshots:
